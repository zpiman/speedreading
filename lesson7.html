        <h2>Lesson 7 - Attention</h2>
<p>Aim of the lesson - to improve your attention level during reading.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier attention is very important in speed reading. For that reason this section will be used to teach you exercises to improve your attention.</p>

<ol>
<li>Green dot exercise. You are already familiar with the rules of this exercise as you have been doing it from the beginning of the course. It is very helpful and the most effective. We recommend you to continue doing it at least once a day on daily bases.</li>

<li>Clock hands. The concept of this exercise is to look at the hand watch and concentrate your whole attention on the second hand. You must not think about anything else except for the hand. If you find this easy, try the exercise with the minute hand.</li>

<li>Detective. In this exercise you pretend to be Sherlock Holmes and you study one object in greater detail. You have one minute and you have to remember as many things about your object as possible. After one minute is done write them down.</li>

<li>Reading a boring book. The concept of this exercise is in its name, to read a not interesting book. This is also a very effective way of developing attention as people tend to think about other things when reading a boring book.</li>

<p>Homework: do each exercise every day at least once a day</p>
