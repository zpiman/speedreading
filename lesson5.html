        <h2>Lesson 5 - Vision Range</h2>
<p>Aim of the lesson - to increase the vision range.</p>

	<p>As mentioned earlier in the course vision range is very important as at low vision range person needs to make more stops to read the same amount of text and therefore needs to spend more time reading it. Therefore in this lesson you will be taught techniques which help you to increase your vision range.</p>

<h4>Schult's Table</h4>

<p>Schult's table is a very simple exercise, which can be created at home with use of pen, paper and scissors. You should take a square piece of paper, draw straight lines, dividing the paper into 25 smaller squares and randomly put in numbers 1 - 25 (do not repeat the numbers). You should have at least 8 different tables.</p>

<p>The way you use the Schult's table is you look at the center number on the paper. Then you try to find numbers 1 - 25 in their order. Try your best not to move your eyes away from the middle number and you should have a rhythm for finding numbers, do not take a very quick rhythm for the first try because you might not be able to keep up. If you cannot find the number straight away move your eyes up and down but not right or left as this exercise also helps you to learn how to vertically read. After completing all the numbers, do it again but at faster speed, time yourself if you want to see your progress. You should complete this exercise (finding 1-25) 10 - 15 times per day, every day.</p>

<p>With practice you should be able to see the whole paper and find the numbers easily, without moving your eyes from the center square.</p>
