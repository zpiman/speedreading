        <h2>Lesson 6 - Vertical reading</h2>
<p>Aim of the lesson - to learn vertical reading technique</p>

<h4>What can you do already?</h4>

<p>Before learning new technique, let's go through the things you learned so far. By now you already learned 5 most important parts of speed reading. Those are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reading without regression</li>
<li>IAR</li>
<li>DAR</li>
<li>Reading without articulation</li>
<li>High vision range</li>
</ol>

	<p>These are 5 out of 7 golden rules of speed reading. You already mastered them and only have 2 more to learn. By now you probably tried reading vertically. If you didn't try to do that right now by taking a book and moving your eyes vertically in the middle. You probably did not manage to succeed. It is no surprise because you are mentally unprepared to do that because you used the traditional reading method your whole life.</p>

<p>In order to help you fight the psychological barrier we suggest you to use the method of storming. The method is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prepare 10-12 books of your favorite genre, each book containing 50-100 pages. You should be familiar with the books. Recommended page size is 20x12 cm and recommended genre is science fiction.</li>
<li>In first 3 books draw straight vertical line in the middle of all the pages.</li>
<li>Read one book per day, spending maximum 15 sec per page.</li>
<li>Control your time with use of preset timer, you can put 25 min timer for 100 pages.</li>
<li>Always move your eyes vertically.</li>
<li>Read book from beginning to the end, without stopping.</li>
</ol>
      
<p>Homework: Read one book per day using the storming method</p>
